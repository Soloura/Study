### [Confidence Intervals](http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/confint.htm)

A confidence interval gives an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter, the estimated range being calculated from a given set of sample data. (Definitoin taken from Valerie J. Easton and John H. McColl's Statistics Glossary v1.1)

The common notation for the parameter in question is theta. Often, this parameter is the population mean mu, which is estimated through the sample mean x bar.

The level C of a confidence interval gives the probability that the interval produced by the method employed includes the true value of the parameter theta.
