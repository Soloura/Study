### Meta Learning | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning_(computer_science))
Meta learning is a subfield of machine learning where automatic learning algorithms are applied to metadata about machine learning experiments. The main goal os to use such metadata to understand how automatic learning can become felxible in solving learning problems, hence to improve the performance of existing learning algorithms or to learn (induce) the learning algorithm itself, hence the alternative term learning to learn.
