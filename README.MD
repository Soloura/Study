## Journal

### Nature | [Homepage](https://www.nature.com/) | [Nature Journal](https://www.nature.com/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal))

Nature is a British weekly scientific journal founded and based in London, England. As a multidisciplinary publication Nature features peer-reviewed research from a variety of academic disciplines, mainly in science, technology, and the natural sciences. It has core editorial offices across the United States, continental Europe, and Asia under the international scientific publishing company Springer Nature. Nature was one of the world's most cited scientific journals by the Science Edition of the 2019 Journal Citation Reports (with an ascribed impact factor of 42.778), making it one of the world's most-read and most prestigious academic journals. As of 2012, it claimed an online readership of about 3 million unique readers per month.

Founded in Autumn 1869, Nature was first circulated by Norman Lockyer and Alexander Macmillan as a public forum for scientific innovations. The mid-20th century facilitated an editorial expansion for the journal; Nature redoubled its efforts in explanatory and scientific journalism. The late-1980s and early-1990s created a network of editorial offices outside of Britain and established ten new supplementary, specialty publications (e.g. Nature Materials). Since the late 2000s, the weekly created dedicated editorial and current affairs columns, as well as electoral endorsements. The primary source of the journal remain, as established at its founding, research scientists; editing standards are primarily concerned with technical readability. Each issue also features articles that are of general interest to the scientific community, namely business, funding, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books, arts, and short science fiction stories.

The main research published in Nature consists mostly of papers (articles or letters) in lightly-edited form. As such they are highly technical and dense, but due to imposed text limits they are typically summaries of larger work. Innovations or breakthroughs in any scientific or technological field is featured in the journal as either letters or news articles. The papers that have been published in this journal are internationally acclaimed for maintaining high research standards. Conversely, due to journal's exposure, it has, at various times, been the subject of controversy for its handling of academic dishonesty, the scientific method, and news coverage. Fewer than 8% of submitted papers are accepted for publication. In 2007 Nature (together with Science) received the Prince of Asturias Award for Communications and Humanity.

### Science | [Homepage](https://www.sciencemag.org/) | [Science Journal](https://science.sciencemag.org/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(journal))

Science, also widely referred to as Science Magazine, is the peer-reviewed academic journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and one of the world's top academic journals. It was first published in 1880, is currently circulated weekly and has a subscriber base of around 130,000. Because institutional subscriptions and online access serve a larger audience, its estimated readership is 570,400 people.

The major focus of the journal is publishing important original scientific research and research reviews, but Science also publishes science-related news, opinions on science policy and other matters of interest to scientists and others who are concerned with the wide implications of science and technology. Unlike most scientific journals, which focus on a specific field, Science and its rival Nature cover the full range of scientific disciplines. According to the Journal Citation Reports, Science's 2019 impact factor was 41.845.

Although it is the journal of the AAAS, membership in the AAAS is not required to publish in Science. Papers are accepted from authors around the world. Competition to publish in Science is very intense, as an article published in such a highly cited journal can lead to attention and career advancement for the authors. Fewer than 7% of articles submitted are accepted for publication.

Science is based in Washington, D.C., United States, with a second office in Cambridge, UK.

### Cell | [Homepage](https://www.cell.com/) | [Cell Journal](https://www.cell.com/cell/home) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(journal))

Cell is a peer-reviewed scientific journal publishing research papers across a broad range of disciplines within the life sciences. Areas covered include molecular biology, cell biology, systems biology, stem cells, developmental biology, genetics and genomics, proteomics, cancer research, immunology, neuroscience, structural biology, microbiology, virology, physiology, biophysics, and computational biology. The journal was established in 1974 by Benjamin Lewin and is published twice monthly by Cell Press, an imprint of Elsevier.

### TPAMI (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence) | [Homepage](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=34) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Transactions_on_Pattern_Analysis_and_Machine_Intelligence)

IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the IEEE Computer Society. It covers research in computer vision and image understanding, pattern analysis and recognition, machine intelligence, machine learning, search techniques, document and handwriting analysis, medical image analysis, video and image sequence analysis, content-based retrieval of image and video, and face and gesture recognition. The editor-in-chief is Sven J. Dickinson (University of Toronto). According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2018 impact factor of 17.730.
